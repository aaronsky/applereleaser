# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I use applereleaser to upload builds?

Applereleaser is not designed to replace `altool`, the recommended Apple-provided tool for validating and uploading archives to Xcode. That tool has an exceptionally well-documented manpage and comes with stability guarantees from the platform-holder. Please use applereleaser to submit your builds once they've been uploaded and completed processing.
