# Quick Start

Once you've [installed](../install) `applereleaser`, you can get started setting it up for your project.

Run `applereleaser init` to create a new `.applereleaser.yml` file in the current directory:

```shell
applereleaser init
```

This will run through a series of prompts where you will get to set some default values for your project. See [configuration.md](./configuration.md) for additional options and documentation on the entire project specification. This file should be checked in to source control.

Once this file is set up, you can either proceed to run `applereleaser` [locally](#local), or set it up in [CI](#ci).

## Local

Follow the guide on the [`release` command in the Command Reference](../commands#release)

## CI

Coming soon!
