.SH NAME
.PP
cider\-release \- Release the selected apps in the current project


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBcider release [path] [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Release the selected apps in the current project.

.PP
You can provide a path to a project directory as an argument to be the root directory
of all relative path expansions in the program, such as the Git repository, preview sets,
and screenshot resources. The only exception to this is if you provide a custom configuration
file path with the \fB\fC\-\-config\fR flag. Instead, that file will be loaded relative to
the working directory of the Cider process itself.

.PP
Additionally, Cider requires a few environment variables to be set in order to operate.
They each correspond to an element of authorization described by the Apple Developer Documentation.

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\fCASC\_KEY\_ID\fR: The key's ID.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\fCASC\_ISSUER\_ID\fR: Your team's issuer ID.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\fCASC\_PRIVATE\_KEY\fR or \fB\fCASC\_PRIVATE\_KEY\_PATH\fR: The .p8 private key issued by Apple.

.RE

.PP
These three values each have varying degrees of sensetivity and should be treated as secrets. Store
them securely in your environment so Cider can leverage them safely.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-A\fP, \fB\-\-all\-apps\fP[=false]
	Process all apps in the configuration file. Supercedes any usage of the \fB\fC\-\-app\fR flag.

.PP
\fB\-a\fP, \fB\-\-app\fP=[]
	Process the given app, providing the app key name used in your configuration file.

.PP
This flag can be provided repeatedly for each app you want to process. You can omit
this flag if your configuration file has only one app defined.

.PP
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-config\fP=""
	Load configuration from file

.PP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP[=false]
	help for release

.PP
\fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-max\-processes\fP=1
	Run certain metadata syncing and asset uploading logic in parallel with
the maximum allowable concurrency.

.PP
\fB\-\-mode\fP=
	Mode used to declare the publishing target for submission.

.PP
The default is "testflight" for submitting to Testflight, and the other alternative
option is "appstore" for submitting to the App Store.

.PP
\fB\-\-set\-beta\-group\fP=[]
	Provide names of beta groups to release to instead of using
the configuration file.

.PP
\fB\-\-set\-beta\-tester\fP=[]
	Provide email addresses of beta testers to release to instead of
using the configuration file.

.PP
\fB\-B\fP, \fB\-\-set\-build\fP=""
	Build override to use instead of "latest". Corresponds to the CFBundleVersion
of your build.

.PP
The default behavior without this flag is to select the latest build. In both cases,
if the selected build has an invalid processing state, Cider will abort with an error
to ensure your release is handled safely.

.PP
\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-set\-version\fP=""
	Version string override to use instead of parsing Git tags. Corresponds to the
CFBundleShortVersionString of your build.

.PP
Cider expects this string to follow the Major.Minor.Patch semantics outlined in Apple documentation
and Semantic Versioning (semver). If this flag is omitted, Git will be leveraged to determine the
latest tag. The tag will be used to calculate the version string under the same constraints.

.PP
\fB\-\-skip\-git\fP[=false]
	Skips deriving version information from Git. Must only be used in conjunction with the \fB\fC\-\-set\-version\fR flag.

.PP
\fB\-\-skip\-submit\fP[=false]
	Skips submitting for review

.PP
\fB\-\-skip\-update\-metadata\fP[=false]
	Skips updating metadata (app info, localizations, assets, review details, etc.)

.PP
\fB\-\-skip\-update\-pricing\fP[=false]
	Skips updating app pricing

.PP
\fB\-\-timeout\fP=30m0s
	Timeout for the entire release process.

.PP
If the command takes longer than this amount of time to run, Cider will abort.
