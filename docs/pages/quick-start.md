# Quick Start

Run `applereleaser init` to create a new `.applereleaser.yml` file in the current directory:

```shell
applereleaser init
```

This will run you through a prompt where you set some default values for your project. See [configuration.md](./configuration.md) for additional options and documentation on the entire project specification. This file should be checked in to source control.
